AI-powered personalized news feed

THE THOUGHT!!!

here is my idea to develop the we application for the topic 

so i wanted to design in such a way that there will be application in that application there will be some categories which has to be selected by the  news reader according to his interest like on ai , cybersecurity , trending events and lot more 
after he specifies the category my app should display all the relavent   news  searching and sorting from all the news across the worls and my project should work on ai based technology and should work on real time data
