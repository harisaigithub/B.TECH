   - Ensure that the site is responsive and works well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

6. **Backend Integration (Optional):**
   - If needed, set up a basic backend for user authentication, score tracking, and leaderboards. You can use serverless technologies like Firebase or deploy a lightweight backend using Node.js.

7. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Implement the core game mechanics, such as generating random words, tracking typing speed, and calculating accuracy.

8. **Timed Mode and Levels:**
   - Add timed modes and levels of difficulty to make the game challenging and engaging for users.

9. **Real-Time Feedback:**
   - Provide real-time feedback to users as they type, highlighting errors and showing progress.

10. **Leaderboard and High Scores:**
   - Incorporate a leaderboard feature to display the top scores and motivate players to compete.

11. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Regularly test the game on different devices and browsers to identify and fix any issues or bugs.

12. **Launch and Iterate:**
   - Once the basic features are implemented, launch the site and gather user feedback. Continuously iterate and improve the game based on user responses.
