Certainly! Let's break down the code into its individual parts and provide an explanation for each section:

Inventory Initialization:



R

inventory <- list()

This line initializes an empty inventory list to store the products. The list will be populated with product information as products are added to the inventory.



Add Product Function:

R

add_product <- function() {
  name <- readline("Enter product name: ")
  quantity <- as.integer(readline("Enter quantity: "))
  price <- as.numeric(readline("Enter price: "))
  
  product <- list(name = name, quantity = quantity, price = price)
  inventory[[length(inventory) + 1]] <- product
  print(paste("Product", name, "added to inventory."))
}


This function allows the user to add a new product to the inventory. It prompts the user to enter the product name, quantity, and price. The input values are then stored in a new list called product, which is appended to the inventory list. A confirmation message is printed to indicate that the product has been added.


Update Quantity Function:

R

update_quantity <- function() {
  name <- readline("Enter product name: ")
  new_quantity <- as.integer(readline("Enter new quantity: "))
  
  for (product in inventory) {
    if (product$name == name) {
      product$quantity <- new_quantity
      print(paste("Quantity of", name, "updated to", new_quantity))
      return()
    }
  }
  print(paste("Product", name, "not found in inventory."))
}


This function allows the user to update the quantity of a specific product in the inventory. It prompts the user to enter the product name and the new quantity. It then iterates over the inventory list and checks if the product name matches any existing product. If a match is found, the quantity is updated with the new value, and a confirmation message is printed. If no match is found, a message indicating that the product was not found is printed.

Generate Report Function:

R

generate_report <- function() {
  total_value <- 0
  cat("Inventory Report:\n")
  for (product in inventory) {
    cat("Product Name:", product$name, "\n")
    cat("Quantity:", product$quantity, "\n")
    cat("Price:", product$price, "\n")
    value <- product$quantity * product$price
    cat("Total Value:", value, "\n")
    total_value <- total_value + value
    cat("\n")
  }
  cat("Total Inventory Value:", total_value, "\n")
}


This function generates a report of the inventory. It iterates over each product in the inventory list and displays its name, quantity, price, and total value (calculated by multiplying quantity and price). At the end, the total value of the entire inventory is displayed.

Main Code Execution:

R

choice <- ""
while (choice != "4") {
  cat("\nE-commerce Inventory Management\n")
  cat("1. Add Product\n")
  cat("2. Update Quantity\n")
  cat("3. Generate Report\n")
  cat("4. Exit\n")
  
  choice <- readline("Enter your choice (1-4): ")
  
  if (choice == "1") {
    add_product()
  } else if (choice == "2") {
    update_quantity()
  } else if (choice == "3") {
    generate_report()
  } else if (choice == "4") {
    cat("Exiting program.\n")




Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

First, we define an empty inventory list to store the products.

The add_product function is defined to add a new product to the inventory. It prompts the user to enter the product name, quantity, and price using the readline function. The input values are then stored in a new list called product, which is appended to the inventory list. A confirmation message is printed to indicate that the product has been added.

The update_quantity function allows the user to update the quantity of a specific product in the inventory. It prompts the user to enter the product name and the new quantity using readline. It then iterates over the inventory list and checks if the product name matches any existing product. If a match is found, the quantity is updated with the new value, and a confirmation message is printed. If no match is found, a message indicating that the product was not found is printed.

The generate_report function generates a report of the inventory. It iterates over each product in the inventory list and displays its name, quantity, price, and total value (calculated by multiplying quantity and price). At the end, the total value of the entire inventory is displayed.

The main part of the code sets up a while loop that continues until the user chooses to exit the program. Within the loop, a menu is displayed with options for the user to choose from. The user's choice is obtained using readline.

Depending on the user's choice, the corresponding function is executed. If the user chooses 1, the add_product function is called to add a new product. If the user chooses 2, the update_quantity function is called to update the quantity of a product. If the user chooses 3, the generate_report function is called to generate an inventory report. If the user chooses 4, a message is printed, indicating the program is exiting. If the user enters an invalid choice, an error message is displayed.

By using this code, you can interactively manage an e-commerce inventory by adding products, updating quantities, and generating inventory reports. You can expand on this code to include more features and functionality as per your requirements.
